Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning – Usage Guide

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and common data science libraries. It builds a content-based recommendation system to suggest movies based on similarity of features such as genres, keywords, and cast.

First, ensure that Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended) is installed on your system. It is advisable to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Install the required libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

After installing the dependencies, navigate to the project folder containing the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file and launch Jupyter Notebook. Open the notebook from the browser interface.

Run all the cells sequentially from top to bottom. The notebook will load the dataset, preprocess the data, create feature vectors, compute similarity scores, and generate movie recommendations.

During execution, the notebook will display processed data samples and recommended movie results. Make sure the dataset file is placed in the same directory as the notebook before running it.

The complete workflow, including data preprocessing, model building, and recommendation generation, is fully contained within the notebook.
